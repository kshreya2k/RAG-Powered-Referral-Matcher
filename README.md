# ðŸ©º WeKare360 Specialist Search Agent (SSA) â€“ RAG Pipeline

This project explores a **multi-agent, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-powered AI system** designed to intelligently match patients with medical specialists based on symptoms, location, insurance, and availability.

Developed as part of a technical assignment for the **WeKare360 One-Click Referral System**, this system parses natural language patient queries and returns a ranked list of specialists with clear, explainable justifications.
